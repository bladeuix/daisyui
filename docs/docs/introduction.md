# Introduction

BladeUIX DaisyUI is a set of components that provides a simple and beautiful way to use [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) in Laravel Blade templates.

## What is DaisyUI?

[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) is a popular [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) plugin that adds component classes to your Tailwind CSS project. Instead of writing long strings of utility classes for every element, you can use semantic class names like `btn`, `card`, `alert`, and many others.

### Key DaisyUI Benefits:

- **Fewer Class Names:** It reduces the number of classes you write by up to 88%, making your HTML much cleaner.
- **Faster Development:** It provides pre-designed components, so you don't have to build every basic UI element from scratch.
- **Smaller File Size:** It can reduce your HTML size by up to 79% by using high-level CSS abstractions.
- **Pure CSS:** Most components don't require any JavaScript, which means better performance and fewer dependencies.
- **Highly Customizable:** Since it's built on top of Tailwind CSS, you can still use utility classes to customize every detail.
- **Built-in Themes:** It comes with 35+ ready-to-use themes that can be applied to your entire application instantly.

## Why BladeUIX DaisyUI?

BladeUIX DaisyUI brings the power of DaisyUI directly into your Laravel applications through native Blade components. It abstracts the class management into clean, semantic components that feel right at home in Laravel.

### Benefits for Laravel Development:

- **Native Blade Components:** Use components directly in your views with a clean syntax: `<x-daisyui::button color="primary">Click Me</x-daisyui::button>`.
- **Semantic Props:** Control component styles using simple props like `color`, `size`, `variant`, `shape`, and `state`. No more messy class strings in your views.
- **Encapsulated Logic:** All CSS class processing and logic are handled within the Blade component classes, keeping your presentation layer minimal and clean.
- **Seamless Integration:** It integrates perfectly with your existing Laravel and Tailwind CSS setup.
- **Consistent Styling:** Enforce consistent design across your application by using standardized component variants.
- **Framework Agnostic:** It doesn't tie you to third-party integrations like Livewire or AlpineJS. You are free to integrate with anything that works with Blade.
